          I joined Tenex as a Software Developer in June 2020. While there I’m in training understanding their large
          software modules. How to participate and contribute to design and development of user experience, before that
          I joined Mid Atlantic Finance as an IT Help Desk on July 2016. From July 2017 to June 2019 I worked as an
          Entry Level .NET C# Developer, then as a Junior .NET Developer until March 2020. This experience
          has enriched my knowledge in designing and developing applications with. NET framework while giving me an
          opportunity of working on projects with different departments such as Finance, Collection and
          IT within others.
